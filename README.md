## üèÜ Featured Projects

Here are a few of the notable projects I've worked on. Check them out for a deep dive into my approaches to machine learning, deep learning, and data engineering.

- **[NLP with Transformers](https://github.com/karimosman89/NLP-with-Transformers):**
  Implemented state-of-the-art text classification models using BERT and fine-tuned them on custom datasets for sentiment analysis and topic classification.

- **[Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/karimosman89/Time-Series-Forecasting):**
  Developed time series forecasting models using LSTM, ARIMA, and Prophet to predict stock prices with visualization and accuracy comparisons.

- **[End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline on AWS](https://github.com/karimosman89/ML-Pipeline-AWS):**
  Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for customer churn prediction using SageMaker, Docker, and CI/CD workflows on AWS.

- **[Real-Time Data Pipeline with Apache Kafka & Spark](https://github.com/karimosman89/Data-Pipeline):**
  Architected a scalable ETL pipeline for processing streaming log data using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, with live dashboards for analytics.
